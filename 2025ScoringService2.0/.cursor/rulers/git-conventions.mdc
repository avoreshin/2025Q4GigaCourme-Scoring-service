# Git Conventions

## Branch Naming
- feature/<task-id>-<short-description>
- fix/<task-id>-<short-description>
- hotfix/<task-id>-<short-description>
- refactor/<task-id>-<short-description>

## Commit Message Format
Use Conventional Commits:
<type>(<scope>): <description>

Allowed types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, perf, ci, build, revert

## Before Committing
- Run linter: npm run lint
- Run tests: npm test
- Verify no console.logs in production code
- Ensure commit is atomic and small
